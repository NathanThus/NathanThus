### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a game design and technology student, who has managed to gain some experience in embedded systems as well!

I've got a website that I tend to keep updated, so if you want to take a look at my projects, either take a look at my repositories or head on over to the website: [a link](https:example.com)
